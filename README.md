I currently have only one repository complete, [__my T24 UserTool__](http://www.github.com/willemgorter/T24UserTool), with interacts 
with Temenos Transact banking software and can do a lot of interesting things to help implementation or operation of Transact. The
next repository I want to realise is for my Translation tool, which helps in translating Transact to local languages, both left-to-right
as well as left-to-right, and Latin-based or not.
