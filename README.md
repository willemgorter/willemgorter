I currently have two repositories complete, [__my T24 UserTool__](https://github.com/willemgorter/T24UserTool), which interacts 
with Temenos Transact banking software and can do a lot of interesting things to help implementation or operation of Transact. The
next repository is for [__my Translation tool__](https://github.com/willemgorter/T24TransactTranslation), which helps in translating Transact to local languages, both left-to-right as well as right-to-left, and Latin-based or not.
